# Base URL for the API server.
#
# Local development uses Vite proxy, so you can leave this empty.
# For hosted deployments where the frontend and API are on different domains,
# set this to your API origin, for example:
#
# VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-api.example.com
#
VITE_API_BASE_URL=

# Optional: restrict which frontend origins can call the API server.
#
# Comma-separated list of allowed origins, for example:
# CORS_ORIGINS=https://your-netlify-site.netlify.app,https://yourdomain.com
#
# If left empty, the API allows requests from any origin (convenient for local use,
# but not ideal for a publicly hosted API).
